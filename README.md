BTM260 Video Game Demo
=================

I developed this game for an assignment for one of my courses, I am currently enrolled in The Year Up program at Seattle Central Community College. This course is not tech-related; this is for my business management course. This assignment is for a group project where we must create a game, a business plan, and a marketing plan.
 
HTML5 Canvas-based version of the spin-off of classic arcade game Frogger, our game is called Toader.
